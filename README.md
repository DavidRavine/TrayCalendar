TrayCalendar
============

TrayCalendar is a minimal popup calendar designed to work in
environments that lack an easy access to a calendar, like i3wm, XMonad
or Awesome.

It is capable of reading the Emacs org-mode files from `~/org/`
(currently hardcoded) and displaying the events found in them.

To display the calendar, left-click on its tray icon. Right-click to
close TrayCalendar completely.

**Keep in mind that TrayCalendar is still in a very early stage of
development.** It probably won't work correctly when the system tray
is not located in the upper right corner of the screen.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

- Python 3
- PyGObject
